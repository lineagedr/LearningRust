# Cargo commands

cargo new             = Creates a new project
cargo clean           = Cleans the project
cargo build           = Builds the project
cargo build -- relase = Builds for release with optimizations
cargo check 	      = Checks if the project can be compiled - This is usually faster than running cargo build
